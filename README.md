## Project Description
Stream Max is a video streaming platform that has become popular because of its curated collection of high quality movies. Given a list of movies for which streaming rights are available, Stream Max has been enlisted to identify which movies their customers will most likely enjoy by predicting the films userâ€™s average rating and providing users with personalized film recommendations based on films that they have previously watched.
